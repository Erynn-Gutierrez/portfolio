                                    Through a visual design akin to the traditional ballot,

                                    ensuring that every citizen can effortlessly

                <p>
                    Voting in the United States presents significant challenges,
                     as citizens are faced with traditional processes that hinder
                      access to what should be free democratic exercise. The 
                      current options, such as attending polling places or navigating
                       through intricate mail-in voting procedures, contribute to 
                       an environment where individuals encounter obstacles such as
                       poll watchers and long lines or failing to return ballots.
                       Additionally, the existing vote-by-mail system relies on paper
                       forms susceptible to errors, leading to the unfortunate outcome
                        of spoiled ballots.

                    How can we create a transparent and accessible platform for eligible voters?
                    We hoped to revolutionize the democratic exercise in the USA 
                    by providing a seamless, secure, and user-friendly platform 
                    that eliminates barriers associated with traditional voting methods. <br><br>
                    Through an online voter interface, we hoped to enhance
                     accessibility, efficiency, and accuracy in the voting process, 
                     thereby empowering citizens to exercise their democratic right
                      with ease and confidence. We hoped to address challenges 
                      related to in-person voting, convoluted mail-in procedures,
                       poll watcher interference, long lines, and ballot spoilage,
                        ushering in a new era of inclusive and efficient voting for all eligible citizens.

                      The level of detail provided for initiatives on U.S. ballots can vary depending on the state/local election practices. In general, when voters receive their ballots, they are given the text of the proposed initiative, along with an explanation. These summaries are often long and are formatted as an unreadable long-form paragraph, without clear representation of what a YES versus NO vote is.

There should also be no locked screen. Users should be able to seek external resources/sites as they wish while they vote. We also hope to provide shortened candidate priorities (ie. Through hashtags like #ForThis), add links to short form videos to watch a quick 30 second video about it to provide more context and understand what their vote for this person actually means.</td>

                      This can vary from state to state and within state, ranging from ordering alphabetically to party primacy.
                      Further, candidate selection is usually compacted to one to two pages, as seen below.

                      With our flow diagram, we decided to break the voting

                      Proposition Selection, Proposition Review, and finally,
                      Ballot Review. By adding in these review processes in 
                      between selection, we hope to aid voters by ensuring 
                      that they ae given the opportunity to check their ballot as
                      they go. This also helps to break down information and
                      minimizes distraction from other selections/sections of the ballot.

                        Considering the large amount of information given to voters,

                        have to click to learn more, whether through enlargening
                        the Candidate View screen by clicking on a candidate, or
                        toggling the expand button for propositions, that we could satisfy
                        the need for any voter, whether or not they are looking for
                        detailed information or looking to speed through the ballot.
                        We also implemented an opt out option for users that may
                        want to abstain from voting on a certain candidate or proposition.

                        We decided to add an introductory flow after the ID verification process
                        that shows the user where the chatbot and settings are located
                        while they go through the voting process. This ensures that
                        users who may need to change/toggle accessibility settings
                        (such as the Text-to-Speech or Read Aloud option) can
                        do so at any point of the voting process, as well as for
                        any user seeking assistance on voting information to do so via
                        the chatbot.

                          To clear up user confusion with selecting a candidate
                          to view or vote for and ease users' sudden overexposure to 
                          information at once, we decided to take on a new design.
                          Much like a paper ballot, this new design simply shows candidates'
                          name next to a checkbox for voters to mark their vote. Users are able to
                          access more information about a candidate, such as their
                          statement and website, by toggling the expanded view
                          via the carrot at the end of the candidate's box. Or, for the
                          user who doesn't care for statements and the like, can mark their
                          vote and move on.

                              One user pointed out that the ballot propositions
                              did not allow users to return to a specific initiative
                              in the case that they would want to refresh the
                              details behind the initiative. (Note that users
                              are still able to change their vote on the Proposition

                              Though not as much as a "pain point", users agreed that
                              including more direct language in voting instructions
                              wouldn't hurt, seeing as this is an official interface
                              and reflective as a government document of sorts; implementing
                              blunt definitions and explanations would help with
                              preventing confusion, as well.

                        Our biggest choice with our final design was adding color to our interface,
                        We wanted maintain the simplicity of our previous iterations which is why
                         we went with a "government" navy blue to emphasize trust
                        and recognition as an official voting interface, contrasting it with an orange, its complement, to allow for
                         high contrast between screen elements and text. 
                        This minimalistic aesthetic is intended to streamline
                        the voting process, reducing visual clutter to minimize cognitive load.

                        the flow, we add a "Did You Register to Vote?"
                        page to explain our theoretical online ID verification that
                        only works if the user has already registered to vote
                        in advance. As for the candidate and proposition pages,
                        we give short purposes of each section and provide crucial
                        information about candidate party affiliations, statements,
                        and propositions that would appear in the offical voter guide
                        or paper ballot.

                        This feature was definitely the hardest to get going, but
                        I challenged myself in learning how to prototype this interaction
                        on Figma; and after a lot of arrows and character controls, I did it!
                        Any of our group members' names can be inputted into the
                        write-in (for tesitng purposes, of course.)
                        To follow the affordances of the paper ballot,
                        which allow write-ins, we implemented a type in write-in
                        box for users, in the case that they wouldn't want to
                        opt out or vote for a candidate.

                    <p>
                      One observation from a user test was interesting: they attempted
                      to go from one proposition to another by clicking on their
                      desired proposition on the progress bar. I decided to implement
                      this as a way for users to skip over propositions, but only in the case
                      where they have already cast a vote up to the most recently submitted "Yes/No".
                      For instance, if there last vote was for propositions 60, they can return
                      to view any proposition before 60. This implementation is interesting as it
                      ensures that users are reading what their vote truly implies.

                      <p>
                        Throughout the design process, I not only learned a lot
                        about how to configure the different features on Figma 
                        such as with components and auto-layout, but also how to design
                        in a way that emphasizes accessibility.
                        I also learned about the many very intricate considerations
                        when it comes to making an interface with such legal implications,
                        while making it to appeal and be accessible to a very varied audience.
                        Most of our group conversations centered around how to
                        make this website safe and secure and accessible to as
                        many as possible, without being politically illogical 
                        or unrealistic.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Overall, our interface succeeds in our goal of accessibility and simplicity.
                        It allows for a personalized accessibility settings, 
                        which helps people with visual impairments, different 
                        familiarities to the voting system, and languages, which isn't
                        as easy to implement with in-person voting. 
                        We allow people to access outside resources to guide their decision while
                        voting, potentially increasing the number of people who vote from home.
                        Lastly, the chatbot allows for personal help throughout
                         the whole voting process, allowing voters to have accurate
                        information easily available, and vote conscientiously.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Though our design was not cyclic, this was intentional
                        as we aimed to alott users the same privileges that in-person
                        voters have out of fairness. We attempted to mediate this by
                        giving users options to go back and review voting decisions

                        I had a great time working on this project, and it was my
                        favorite of the semester. I thank my team for a great 4 weeks
                        working together, as well as my Professor Dave Miller, 
                        and TA, Cass Burns for their guidance through this process.
                      </p>

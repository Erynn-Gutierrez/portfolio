                                    We aimed to develop a web-extension app that 
                                    redirects online shoppers from fast fashion websites to

                                    Second Chance aims to educate shoppers in the process, by 
                                    informing them of their environmental impact (saved water, 
                                    fuel) based on this switch, with the goal of shifting 
                                    consumers towards maintaining sustainable shopping habits.

                <p>
                    Current fast fashion websites prioritize affordability and style,
                     leaving users unaware of the environmental and ethical 
                     impact of their purchases. The lack of easily accessible 
                     information and alternatives hinders consumers from making 
                     informed choices that align with their values. Further, the
                      time-consuming process of manually researching sustainability 
                     credentials or searching for alternative options discourages 
                    users from adopting more sustainable shopping habits.

                    We found that these extensions either focused solely on 
                    providing sustainability ratings OR sustainable alternatives.
                    But why choose one over the other? We chose to develop a path that 
                    combines these elements, that compares and rates similar 
                    fashion items based on features such as sustainability,

                                    Chiara is a college-educated 24-year-old technical sales representative based out of Boston, MA. During her free time, she likes to thrift. Thrifting is easy on her pockets and is good for her conscience, as she is opposed to fast fashion. Lately, however, she has been seeing advertisements for particular seasonal garments that she really likes from fast fashion brands. She views these garments on fast fashion sites and does a parallel search for similar items on thrifting sites, but consistently comes up short despite hours of searching. She does not like going through this arduous process and wishes that there was a way to quickly search multiple sites at once for the kind of clothing items that she is looking for.

                                    Fiona is a long-time office receptionist at a local Maryland paper company.  She enjoys couponing and loves a good deal.  As a mother of 4, most of her salary goes towards funding her children, which is why she does not have a lot of time to herself, and barely any spare money to purchase the things she wants. Though Fiona still dreams of wearing the clothes her higher-ups and co-workers wear, from Ann Taylor blouses to Banana Republic dress pants to Vince Camuto pumps. She wishes that there was a way for her to afford these brands as well as have a purchasing process that does not take more time out of her long days.

                                 when finding and working within our proposed
                                 framework:
                                <br><br>
                                <strong>Time</strong> - Online shoppers spend hours searching online for the perfect item, but frequently arrive at dead ends.
                                <br>
                                <strong>Relevance</strong> - Fashion-forward consumers enjoy following trends seen from fast fashion brands, but cannot find a exact equivalent secondhand since it will be a while until new products trickle down to thrift stores, usually once they're out of season.
                                <br>
                                <strong>Affordability</strong> - Fashion-forward consumers often come across desired clothing that is out of budget
                                <br>
                                <strong>Ease of Use</strong> - Online purchasing processes are a hassle, and often indirect.

                      In this stage, we realized that users have many different
                      ways of sourcing items when online shopping. Many people browse online,
                      of course, but other users may find inspiration via Pinterest, or in their
                      favorite celebrity's recent paparazzi photos. There's also
                      users who are adamantly in-person shoppers. How do we bring them in?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To attract as many users as possible, we included an Image Search feature
                      so that any kind of shopper could use this extension. Whether a screenshot
                      from Instagram or a picture of a passerby on the street, this feature
                      aims to attract any kind of shopper to use our extension, even when
                      offline.

                      After looking at our first prototype for the recommendation tab, we faced the challenge of defining what a bookmarked item is. We had to figure out whether or not we wanted to localize this system with the app’s provided matches, or on top of this localized system, include an external “liked” tab for retail sites to influence the user’s recommendation attributes. <br><br> However, we found that this overlap would be confusing, and decided to not offer an external like button on regular retail sites, and change the Bookmarked section into a “Likes” section for localized matches. In terms of influencing the Recommendation tab, we decided to also localize the results under this tab based on their liked items, and treat this section akin to a feed of miscellaneous recommendations based on the attributes of items they have liked.

                      <strong>Observation #1:</strong> Users struggled with identifying the Recommendation and Liked tabs. Since there is no official “recommendation” icon, we initially went with the medal, but this was confusing for users. <br>
                      <strong>Change:</strong> Label the individual icons when they are clicked upon, and change the Recommendation icon to be more recognizable.

                      The extension was overall successful at achieving its purpose and users were able to complete most, if not all tasks, with little assistance.

                      Another comment from multiple tests was that it was not clear where the recommended tab was or that they did not know what the recommendation icon was.

                      <strong>Pain Point #1:</strong> Users struggled with the

                      adding a brand name alongside their picture to help the 
                      system identify as close of a match as possible. A user commented
                      that there were too many "options" at once that the choice for them
                      to make was unclear.
                      <br>
                      <strong>Change: </strong>Separate the flow of uploading a new picture and
                      adding a brand name for clarity.

                    This redesign maintains all of the same core features as the last design, but has improved usability for certain workflows. For instance, the image search function now splits the final step into two separate pages: Uploading a different image is now on one page and identifying the brand of the uploaded garment/skipping onto matches is on the following page. 
                    We decided to keep the step of filtering in image search instead of eliminating it, even though we had multiple users state that this step was confusing in our first round of usability testing. Instead we improved upon this step by including a “What is this step for?”, and including a color difference between the Next and Skip buttons to provide clarity on the image search process for the user. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We also labeled all of the bottom navigation icons as users from our usability tests had displayed confusion over what each of the icons mean. The recommendation icon appeared to be the least identifiable of all of the icons, but we opted to keep it the same because 1) there are few universal icons for “recommendations,” and 2) we believed the label would resolve any confusion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The match page has also been revamped to include larger images and different views of garments as per the request of several participants in our usability studies. All other information on the page is maintained. We hoped that the introduction of higher fidelity screens and colors would eliminate any confusion over what is and what is not a button. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lastly, we included an FAQ page to the profile section of the extension. This page was not explicitly requested by participants in any of the studies, but we felt it would be a helpful addition to the prototype in case anyone has any questions or concerns regarding the purpose or use of the extension.

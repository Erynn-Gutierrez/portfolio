                    We ran a survey.<br>
                    We led interviews.<br>
                    We met the <strong>22%</strong>.

                <p>
                    And they weren’t a monolith.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Through our office-wide interview interest survey, we first asked employees to self-assess their comfort with AI, to help us pinpoint those infrequent users. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    From our interviews, we found <strong>two</strong> types of users with infrequent Open usage with a difference in their mindsets, barriers, and needs.

                <p>
                    The <strong>Gloomers</strong> are our practical skeptics. They’re not against
                    innovation per se, but they see tools like AI as unreliable,
                    generic, and ultimately a waste of time.
                </p>

                <p>

                    What holds them back is a belief that the tool’s output is too inaccurate,
                    leading to extra work to clean it up. What they the
                    most is proof of value, or evidence that the tool
                    actually helps, rather than hinders, their work.
                </p>


                <p>
                    On the other side, we have the <strong>Doomers</strong>, our
                    principled objectors. Their resistance is not about convenience—it’s about values.
                    They see AI a tool that is undermining professional ethics, and even harming creativity.
                    Their fear is deeper—it’s about losing what makes their work meaningful.
                 </p>

                <p>
                    What Doomers need is a new philosophy—so this would be finding a new outlook towards AI usage as something that won't take away from their professional standards.

                <h5>The Problem</h5>

                <p>We found that for both Doomers and Gloomers, skepticism is rooted in fear.</p>

                <a href="img/obi-problem.png" data-lightbox="obi-problem" data-title="OBI Challenge">
                    <img src="img/obi-problem.png" alt="obi-problem" class="img-fluid">
                </a>

                <p>
                    Specifically of two things:<br>
                    One, the fact that years of building a craft could be dismissed to a quick AI-generated result.<br>
                    And two, lowering the quality of their work, which can harm their credibility in the workplace.<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Reputation is incredibly invaluable. Losing that could have real consequences.
                    So when people hesitate to use AI, it's not just about

                    So how do we move forward? We think <strong>it’s time for a
                    thoughtful shift in behaviors and attitudes towards Open

                <p>
                    For <strong>Gloomers</strong>, the shift is from Avoidance to Practical Application.
                    That means showing how these tools can work for them and save them time.

                <p>
                    For <strong>Doomers</strong>, the shift is from Principled Resistance to Critical Engagement.

                Ultimately, this led us to reframe how we view skepticism, and straight into our insight.

                Their concerns are not only valid—they’re necessary. They keep us grounded, intentional, and we should value them,
                So rather than fighting skepticism, we need to engage it. Learn from it. Build with it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Because when we do that, we won’t just be adopting new tools—we’ll be doing it in a way that respects the craft, protects quality, and strengthens trust across the organization.

            <h5>Stunt Launch: Capturing Attention</h5>

            <section id="stunt-1">
                <p>
                    First, we’re turning Ogilvy North America offices into 
                    <span id="creative-asset">crime scenes</span>.
                </p>

                <a href="img/obi-experiential-1.png" data-lightbox="obi-experiential-1" data-title="OBI Experiential 1">
                    <img src="img/obi-experiential-1.png" alt="obi-experiential-1" class="img-fluid">
                </a>
                
                <p>
                    Why? Because when an idea flatlines, we all want to know why.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At Ogilvy, we don’t believe in creative complacency. We care about the work — and we believe the lifeblood of great ideas is worth protecting.
                </p>
            </section>


            <section id="stunt-2">
                <p>
                    Next, <span id="creative-asset">cryptic posters</span> will appear in office, hinting at what killed
                    the work and stirring intrigue across Ogilvy North America.
                </p>

                <a href="img/obi-posters.png" data-lightbox="obi-posters" data-title="OBI Posters">
                    <img src="img/obi-posters.png" alt="obi-posters" class="img-fluid">
                </a>
                
                <p>
                    These posters will spark real conversation: What’s happening? What are these clues pointing to? And what is this stunt laddering up to?
                    One poster reads: “When you stop questioning, the case goes cold.”
                    Another warns: “False certainty is the killer of great work.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    Poster 2 specifically acknowledges the natural skepticism we
                    have. It validates that skepticism as a professional asset
                    rather than a barrier, which helps build trust.
                    Instead of dismissing doubts, we lean into them and position
                    the campaign as something that respects and even depends on that critical mindset.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each poster lands on the creative wrap of our campaign —
                    the tagline: “Lead the investigation.”
                    In the corner, a partially revealed OBI logo offers a subtle
                    clue of what’s coming next.
                </p>

                    An <span id="creative-asset"> evidence board</span> with
                    detective-style prompts appears in offices, leaving a clue
                    for what's coming next.

                </a>
                
                <p>
                    This board will feature detective-inspired prompts that encourage critical thinking, both about detective work and our own Ogilvy process.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Phrases like:<br>
                    “Never trust the first idea.”<br>
                    “Follow the evidence trail, not the assumptions.”<br>
                    “Every detail counts... examine all the leads.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These prompts are designed to spark curiosity and conversation
                    throughout Ogilvy North America, asking: "Why are we now in
                    the detective’s den? What is this?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    This invites everyone to begin to step into the mindset of
                    a real investigator — questioning, analyzing, and uncovering
                    what lies beneath the surface.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The goal is of this to get people excited by this stunt,
                    and encourage everyone to care more deeply and pay closer
                    attention to the professional standards they uphold — treating
                    the quality of work like a puzzle or case to investigate and improve.

                <p>
                    This brings us to our last phase. Here, we shift from the
                    campaign buzz to prolonged OBI involvement, converting employee's
                    familiarity with the OBI into active participation with the community.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The mindset here pushes forward past the non-user perception
                    of Open as a threat to their standards, to a tool that helps
                    them identify how they can interrogate their cases better,
                    and shows that proof of value they need.

                    The evidence board from earlier? It's opening its first case:
                    the <span id="creative-asset">Dead End of the Week</span>—
                    where employees post the WPP Open prompts
                    that didn’t go as planned.

                <p>
                    This brings WPP Open offline and right into the office as a
                    <span id="creative-asset">physical, shared workspace</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It’s a fun way to make experimenting with the tool visible,
                    normalize learning through trial and error, and invite everyone
                    in their local office to investigate together. This creates
                    an active, collaborative hub for Open in the workplace.

                    where Open's oddest outputs are under investigation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Following the red string, detectives are asked,
                    "How would you have prompted this investigation better?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    Above, you can see the Dead End comes from an Art Director
                    who's having trouble generating a specific image.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All these sticky notes and red strings? The responses of our
                    detectives who are on the case to better interrogate Open
                    and get closer to the solve of the image.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At the bottom left corner, all employees are invited to
                    submit a Dead End of their own to be featured the following week,
                    and to encourage the learning of different uses and approaches
                    to Open across departments.

                    Dropping twice a month, the OBI Files spotlight Open-powered
                    campaigns. Here, you can see the Sprite account's
                    <i>Hurts So Good</i> campaign that utilized Open, with a
                    summary from the team detailing how they used it in their process.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The newsletter also shares skeptic-turn-champion stories, and
                    Detective O.'s Open tips and tricks. The goal of the OBI families?
                    To keep momentum and culture of the campaign alive past the
                    stunt and learning phases.

                    Given a challenge to solve, we provide hands-on prompts to work through

                <p>
                    After 2 weeks of prepping supplies, planning, and logistics,
                    we believe that the campaign can start in August. This will
                    also ensure enough time for employees to get familiar with
                    our campaign as well as reach the 80% adoption goal by EOY.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Phase 1 will occur over Days 1-6. First come the in-office
                    crime scenes, then the teaser posters, followed by the installation
                    of the Evidence Board. The goal is to spark curiosity, buzz,
                    and water-cooler chatter. Note that there is no mention of Open
                    or Detective O just yet.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Phase 2 will occur over Days 7-11. First comes the Detective O
                    reveal. From there, his snarky tweets, “wear the hat” posts,
                    and social teasers will roll out. The goal is to establish
                    Detective O's tone and invite low-pressure exploration to Open.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A week later, the Persona on WPP Open debuts - we'll invite
                    employees to enter Open, and dabble with his character about
                    anything regarding the OBI, to getting a hardhitting opinion
                    on their work.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Phase 3 will occur starting Day 12 and on. At the start of the week,
                    the evidence board launches as an interactive prompt hub.
                    At the end of the week, Newsletter #1 launches. 2 weeks later,
                    Swag is awarded and Newsletter #2 drops to celebrate the contributors.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Bi-weekly challenges, newsletters, and evidence board updates
                    are ongoing to keep the momentum alive.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mid-way through October, we'll gauge how well the the campaign
                    is going, and if Open usage is up - if needed, we'll launch
                    an energizer campaign using the Halloween tentpole as leverage.

                <p>
                    In measuring campaign success, we're looking at two key areas:
                    how people are engaging with the campaign creatively, AND
                    whether we’re actually changing behavior inside the platform.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So yes, we’ll track social traction, submissions, newsletter
                    opens — but more importantly, we’ll monitor how often people
                    come back to Open, how deeply they’re using it, and which
                    departments are building it into their workflow.

            <section id="vision">
                <h5>Campaign Vision</h5>
                <p>
                    At its core, this campaign celebrates healthy skepticism as
                    the spark for mastery—positioning Open not as a crutch, but
                    as the precision tool employees wield to interrogate every idea,
                    prove their expertise, and fuel their curiosity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We need a movement: A cultural, behavorial, and language
                    switch to occur in office to showcase that employees really do wear
                    the hats, and the work they do is much like being a detective.
                    The work comes questions, a drive to find more and do better,
                    and  get to the bottom of things. A reminder that each
                    and every employee is Detective O- someone who thinks deeply 
                    and is eager to put their best foot foward.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And lastly, we need a space where it's ok to have doubt and
                    skepticism toward AI, and to understand it as our greatest
                    asset and use it to bring ourselves to fullest ability.
                </p>

                <p>So wear the hat. Lead the investigation.</p>

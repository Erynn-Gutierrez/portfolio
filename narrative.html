                      <p>Narrative Bookshop is a local bookshop in Davis Square, Somerville, MA, that opened in May 2024.
                        It is an immigrant-woman owned and operated business run by Mila Hossain. 
                        The bookshop offers a welcoming space for finding connection through a curation of BIPOC authors and community-minded events.
                        Narrative's offerings include books, their cozy community space, author signings, book talks, wellness events, craft nights, yoga classes, and more.</p>

                <h5>Hossain's Vision</h5>
                <p>
                    Through Narrative Bookshop, Hossain aims to create an inclusive environment where everyone feels welcome to explore new ideas and perspectives. She envisions Narrative not just as a book shop, but as a hub for discovery, through her curation that empowers voices that have traditionally been marginalized in mainstream literature.

                <p class="caption">Hossain's vision for Narrative is deeply rooted in her personal journey as an immigrant and her passion for literature.</p>
                <p>
                    Hossain's journey has not been easy; she has navigated the challenges of establishing a business while managing all aspects of operations, from running the store to organizing events and engaging with customers on social media. By focusing on community-minded events and thoughtful curation, Hossain seeks to inspire a love for reading while supporting local authors and fostering connections among residents in Somerville and beyond. Her vision is clear: Narrative Bookshop is a place where stories come alive, and every visitor can find their narrative.

                    <h5>Organic Performance</h5>

                    <p>Currently, Narrative does not run any paid media. On the social side, Narrative is active on Instagram and Facebook. In their own website, Bookshop.org for online sales, and Eventbrite for ticket sales.</p>

                    <p>
                        On the organic side, Narrative is performing extremely well, particularly on Instagram. Hossain, who has shared deeply personal stories of what it's like being a first-time small business owner, has
                        developed a strong base of dedicated followers who actively engage with her content. Since the account's beginnings in December 2023, @narrativebookshop has amassed over 5.8k followers (as of
                        January 2025).

                    <p>
                        Pictured above on the top are examples of Narrative's most sucessful content: the left-most post, which merely announced the opening of the store, gained 763 likes and 63 comments.
                        Comments of encouragement, admiration, and excitement, like that of the screengrabs on the bottom, which populate every single other post of @narrativebookshop.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      With such high organic performance and engagement, Narrative has high potential for launching a paid media plan.

                                    Leveraging lookalike audiences based on website visitors and social media engagers helps discover new potential customers with similar characteristics.

                                <p>
                                    The consideration stage builds on initial awareness, focusing on deepening engagement. By targeting current followers of Narrative's platforms and individuals who interacted with awareness-stage content, the campaign nurtures interest and moves potential customers closer to visiting the store or attending events.

                          <strong>Why?</strong>
                          Meta's integrated ecosystem allows for cross-promotion between Facebook and Instagram, maximizing reach and engagement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          For reach, the goal is to show your ads to the maximum number of unique users within your target audience. 
                          Meta's <u>Awareness campaigns</u> optimize for reach by ensuring your message is seen by as many distinct individuals as possible,
                          with features like the store location feature, which will be detailed below.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                          For engagement, the goal is to maximize the number of people 
                          who have shown interest to engage in a certain action.
                          For the goal of engaging more people to Narrative's events,
                          Meta's <u>Engagement campaigns</u> will optimize for
                          the maximum amount of people to indicate interest in
                          or intention to attend your Facebook event.

                          Targeting the Massachusetts/New England audience for Narrative Bookshop's "Buy Local Supporters" campaign is a strategic choice that aligns well with the store's mission and local business ethos.
                          New England has a strong culture of supporting independent businesses, as evidenced by initiatives like Small Business Strong, which has served over 3,600 businesses and preserved nearly 10,000 jobs in the region.
                          This demonstrates a robust ecosystem of local business support.

                          By focusing on the Massachusetts/New England audience, Narrative Bookshop can tap into regional pride and the established "buy local" mentality. This approach resonates more authentically with the concept of supporting a Somerville-based small business, compared to targeting distant cities like LA or Chicago. Below are targets specific to this local audience on Meta.

                                At this stage, local supporters are primed for action, needing only the right incentive or compelling message to make a purchase and support Narrative Bookshop, even from afar.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  Buy Local Supporters outside of Boston are part of the conversion stage of the funnel because they have already demonstrated an interest in supporting independent businesses and are likely familiar with the concept of buying local.

                                <p>
                                  These individuals, particularly those interested in literature, social justice, and cultural events, align closely with Narrative Bookshop's mission and offerings. By targeting lookalikes of previous purchasers, the campaign reaches people with similar characteristics to those who have already converted, increasing the likelihood of sales.

                                ad that brings books back into the narrative. 
                                Starting off with a clearer CTA that defines the sale as
                                a curated selection, this mock ties loose ends with
                                its carousel format, which showcases the 3 top-selling
                                books of the week that are included in the fall sale.

                                Again, we are able to track book sales on Bookshop.org

                          <p>
                            <strong>Why?</strong>
                            Users engage with Pinterest content three times slower than on other platforms, allowing for deeper connections and more thoughtful consideration of products and services. This slower pace of engagement provides an opportunity for businesses to showcase their offerings in detail and build stronger relationships with potential customers.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Pinterest functions more like a search engine than a traditional social media platform, effectively combining the intent-driven nature of Google with the visual appeal of Instagram. This hybrid approach makes it particularly effective for reaching users who are actively searching for inspiration, ideas, and products with the intention to take action.
                          </p>
                          
                          <p>
                            To optimize for conversion on Pinterest, leverage features Product Pins and the Shop Tab,
                            which are explained in further detail below.

                              Above, the leftmost mock is the Shop Tab: a dedicated
                              space for browsing Product Pins, this feature 
                              further enhances the shopping experience. 
                              It allows users to search for specific items 
                              and filter results by price and brand, increasing 
                              the likelihood of conversion. 

                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Product Pins provide rich details about items, 
                              including pricing and availability, making it easier
                               for users to make purchase decisions. A cool plus
                               about these pins is that all of its text, including
                               the text on the literal pin, are included in Pinterest's
                               SEO keywords. If you wanted to go the extra mile,
                               adding text on the creative can boost the power of
                               the ad.

                              which can be tracked via pixel.
